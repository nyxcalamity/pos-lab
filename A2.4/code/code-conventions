C++ Code Styles (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html) are considered to
be the base for this project. The next points only alter or extend them:

- every comment is to be separated from a comment delimiter by a space and to be started with a capital
letter
// Like this

- a comment should always start above the code block it relates to and should always have the same 
indentation, everything else is to be treated as a temporary code that ultimately must to be removed

- a function comment should always be composed of complete sentences.

- line width is 120 chars, it can be longer only if moving remainder to a new string will leave it 
almost completely empty or if the grouping of arguments/commands makes more sense

- there should be a minimum of 2 line break between functions or include declaration and functions, 
which is to be counted excluding any comments in between. Thus if there are comments in between the 
former, the break can be extended by the number of lines the comment is taking

- commented out code should not be present in the project unless otherwise specified by the commenter
and when having a TODO or FIXME action designation
